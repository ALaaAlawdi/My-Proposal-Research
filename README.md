# My-Proposal-Research

Entering the world of scientific research is a fun and tiring thing at the same time. Analysis, deduction, and reading results and previous research on a particular thing. The greatness of searching for information and adhering to the restrictions of scientific research. This is a very enjoyable thing and my passion for it is great, especially in the field of computational neuroscience.
